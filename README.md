# Quantum_Machine_Learning

This is a small repository that shows some basic applications of the quantum machine learning methods from qiskit-machine-learning

The full documentation on all scripts still needs to be done.

exp_SU2 contains all scripts for performing the experiments on SU(2) random data.


exp_art contains all scripts for performing the experiments on ain artificially generated data from sci-kit learn.


exp_bench continas all scripts for the experiments on benchmark data sets.
